# Fresh Tomatoes Project
This tool reads a list of movie data from a JSON file and displays
the movies, along with their posters, in a grid on a Web page. Clicking
on the movie opens its trailer.

## Installation
This requires [Python](https://www.python.org/). Choose either the
latest 3.x or 2.x version. As of the last update to this document, those
versions were 3.6.3 and 2.7.14.

Clone the repo and then run `python entertainment_center.py` from the
directory you cloned.

## Limitations
This tool does not allow you to search the Web for movies or help you
enter the data in the JSON file. For now, it just renders and displays
a Web page with the movie data in it.

There are no tests in the
[master](https://github.com/twwilliams/ud036_StarterCode/tree/master)
branch. There is a version of the code in the
[with-tests](https://github.com/twwilliams/ud036_StarterCode/tree/with-tests)
branch that has been rewritten to be testable and includes a set of
[py.test](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) tests. You will need to
[install py.test](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html#installation)
if you don't already have it on your system.

## Running Tests
Limited to the
[with-tests](https://github.com/twwilliams/ud036_StarterCode/tree/with-tests)
branch for now.

1. [Install py.test](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html#installation)
1. From the root of the repository, run `pytest` or `python -m pytest`
